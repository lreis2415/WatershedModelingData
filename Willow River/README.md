## 1. Data

|                                   | Willow River Watershed                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| DEM                               | DEM with a resolution of 30 m from National Elevation Data, USGS |
| Land use                          | Land use map from National Land Cover Data (NLCD, 2011 Edition), USGS |
| Soil                              | Soil dataset from the Soil Survey Geographic database (SSURGO), U.S. Department of Agriculture-Natural Resource Conservation Service |
| Meteorological data               | Daily meteorological data from 2008 to 2014 provided by Climate Forecast System Reanalysis Dataset, U.S. National Centers for Environmental Prediction |
| Agricultural management practices | Crop rotations, tillage practices, and fertilizer usage collated from Almendinger and Murphy (2007) |
| Observed data at the outlet       | Daily flow and ammonia plus organic nitrogen data (from 1 October 2010 to 31 July  2014) measured at the monitoring station of the USGS (no. 05341687) |

## 2. Model performance using SWAT+ (v59.3)

The calibration period ranges from 1 January 2012 to 31 July 2014, and the validation period is from 1 October 2010 to 31 December 2011
